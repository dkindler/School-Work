MIPS Maze Solver
===================


The following is a school project that solved a maze by first using the left hand rule, returning to the beginning by tracing back, then solving again by using a  recursive back tracking algorithm.

Attached is a PDF which includes the assignment. Please note only the .ASM file was created by me.  All other files were provided by the professor for this course.
